## Analysis
### Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to provide insights into Sadie's Snacks' sales data, specifically focusing on cookie sales. We aim to answer the CEO's query regarding “How to predict cookie sales and optimize ingredient inventory?” The analysis will concentrate on the sales quantity aspect of the problem.

### Relevance
Understanding and predicting cookie sales are vital for Sadie's Snacks to efficiently manage their ingredient inventory. Unpredictable sales patterns have led to ingredient shortages and product obsolescence. This analysis aims to provide data-driven solutions to these inventory management challenges.

### Results
#### 1. Seasonal Trends
###### a) Quarterly Sales Fluctuations:
The analysis uncovers clear quarterly sales trends for cookies. Sales start the year modestly in Q1, increase notably in Q2, and then sharply decline by approximately 20% in the low-demand Q3, potentially due to post-holiday factors. Conversely, Q4 sees a remarkable sales surge of over 30%, marking the busy season from October to mid-December, likely driven by holiday festivities.
###### b) Monthly Sales Peaks:
Looking beyond quarterly data, analyzing monthly sales reveals important seasonal patterns. February, June, and December emerge as peak months, coinciding with the high points of their respective quarters. February follows Valentine's Day, June anticipates summer events, and December sees a substantial surge due to the holiday season. Conversely, during the low season in Q3, monthly sales in July, August, and September remain consistently low, indicating a uniform decline in demand during these months, unlike the other quarters.
#### 2. Cookie Type Analysis
- Arrowroot Cookies: Sales remain consistent throughout the year, closely following the annual average, with minor fluctuations in February and November. However, a significant 50% dip in sales during the second quarter highlights the need for inventory adjustments to prevent ingredient shortages and waste.
- Oatmeal Raisin Cookies: Monthly sales show more variability compared to Arrowroot cookies. While the overall trend aligns with other types, the third quarter's sales remain relatively stable compared to the early second quarter. This suggests an opportunity for exploring the third quarter's market segment, warranting further investigation.
- Chocolate Chip Cookies: Exhibiting the highest sales fluctuations among the three types, these cookies peak in February, June, and December. It's worth noting that December's spike is primarily driven by Chocolate Chip cookies, as the other two types show declining sales during this period. To manage inventory effectively, a more dynamic approach is required for Chocolate Chip Cookies, considering these fluctuations. Inventory should be adjusted to meet the heightened demand during peak months and reduced during low-demand periods, such as the third quarter.
#### 3. Regional Differences
- The East region consistently outperforms the West in terms of average sales.
- While there are limited monthly sales data for each region, this suggests that inventory distribution should be adapted to regional variations.
#### 4. Predicting Sales Increase
- Industry experts predict a 3% increase in the sales quantity of gourmet cookies.
- Inventory adjustments should not only consider the overall increase but also assess if the increase is consistent across months, cookie types, or regions.
- If the 3% increase is distributed evenly throughout the year and across cookie types and regions, inventory adjustments should be made to match this overall growth. This means that after adjusting the inventory levels based on the seasonality and the sales distribution between different regions and different cookie types, Sadie’s Snacks should consider adding 3% of inventory to cover the expected rise in sales.

### Recommendations
#### 1. Inventory Management based on Type: 
To minimize ingredient shortages and obsolescence, Sadie's Snacks should adjust ingredient purchases based on seasonal and cookie-specific sales patterns. Special attention should be given to Chocolate Chip cookies, which exhibit significant fluctuations. Sadie’s Snacks should also consider applying marketing campaigns to promote the sales of other types of cookies, which can help with consistency in sales and inventory, lowering the cost of time spent on specialized calculations for cookie types.
#### 2. Regional Inventory Allocation: 
Adapt inventory distribution strategies to account for the varying sales performance between the East and West regions. Inventory allocation should be proportional to regional demand. Marketing strategies should also be used in the regions to boost sales in the West while continuing to maintain and enhance sales in the East.
#### 3. Further Analysis: 
Future analyses should focus on the regional disparities, evaluating whether specific marketing or sales strategies can be implemented in the West region to boost sales. Moreover, Sadie’s Snacks should consider whether the 3% increase in quantity sales next year is not consistent and varies across time, cookie types, or regions, a more nuanced approach is required. It's essential to monitor where the increase is most significant and adjust inventory accordingly. Additionally, if one cookie type contributes more to this growth, special focus should be placed on its production and distribution. Besides, considering factors like external events or competitor activities might provide insights into sales variations.

## Conclusion
This analysis offers a foundation for Sadie's Snacks to optimize cookie sales predictions and ingredient inventory management. By following these recommendations and continually monitoring sales data, the company can enhance its overall performance and profitability.
